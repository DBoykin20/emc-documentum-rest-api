This repository contains sample code that demonstrates how to write EMC Documentum applications using the REST API.

The REST API is platform and programming language independent. Currently, we provide three examples showing how it can
be used in various client environments:

- **html5-client-samples**: HTML5 REST client using Angular + Bootstrap
- **java-client-samples**: Java REST client
- **dotnet-client-samples**: Microsoft .NET client
